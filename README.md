## Requirements

I own a Ryzen 5600x, and a Radeon 6900XT.
In my case, my component are in the custom watercooling loop w/ 360 & 280 rad. And both with liquid metal as thermal compound.

For both CPU and GPU, lower is your temp, better are your component.
AMD provide for both a 'mechanism' which is basically « If I had more thermal headroom. I'm gonna use it ». That's how PBO works, and the frequency boost from AMD GPU.


## CPU

Well, what you need to do is enable PBO, find your limits if you need to. If you have enough thermal headroom, you can simply enable limits as « motherboard », and found your correct Curve Optimizer.

All core curve optimizer is not really the best. You have some weaker core than other. Personnaly, my 5600x was stable at all core -30. 
But in some rare game (Forza Horizon 5) it cause me stutter.

Luckily, (1usmus)[https://mobile.twitter.com/1usmus] made a great tool for lazy man : (Project Hydra)[https://www.igorslab.de/en/project-hydra-oc-sandbox-for-zen3-cpus-freeware-download/]
